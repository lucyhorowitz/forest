\title{conclusory role}
\import{macros}

\p{The \strong{conclusory role} of #{\varphi} is the collection of sets #{X,Y\subseteq\frakB} for which #{\langle X, Y\cup\{\varphi\}\rangle} is a "good" [[role-0007]]. In other words, it is the collection of implications in which #{\varphi} is a conclusion. It can also be viewed as the [[role-000A]] of the pair #{\langle\emptyset,\{\varphi\}\rangle}.}
