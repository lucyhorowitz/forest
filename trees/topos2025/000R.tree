\p{The \strong{premisory role} of #{\varphi} is the collection of sets #{X,Y\subseteq\frakB} for which #{\langle X\cup\{\varphi\}, Y\rangle} is a "good" [[0007]]. In other words, it is the collection of implications in which #{\varphi} is a premise. It can also be viewed as the [[logic-000A]] of the pair #{\langle\{\varphi\},\emptyset\rangle}.}
