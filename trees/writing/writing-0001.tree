\p{Today (June 17, 2025) was the second meeting of the [AI Risk Reading Group](ai-risk-2025). A lot of the discussion centered around the section on "misaligned culture" from [\em{Gradual Disempowerment}](ref-0007). This was surprising to some people given that the other two main things that could be misaligned (states and the economy) seem much more substantial or consequential.}

\p{The authors of [\em{Gradual Disempowerment}](ref-0007) talk about "AI-dominated culture" which is necessarily completely alien to our current understanding of culture. Art by AI, for AI? What would that look like? Why would they even want to create art? I thought that a large part of the discussion we had today stemmed from a few things: it being difficult to even imagine powerful beings with incomprehensible motives, and it being difficult to envision a path to getting to a point where such things exist.}

\subtree{\title{A lot of the hard work imagining has been done for us already}

\p{When we think about someone or something taking actions, we often consider their motivations. For an AI or ecosystem of AIs to take over the economy or the government makes sense: these would be important channels through which they can achieve what we assume their goals might be, and we more or less assume that these will be self-perpetuation and perhaps "world domination."}

\p{For AI to take over culture is a little bit less understandable. Of course, there is the obvious "keep humans docile by pacifying them with slop" tactic, but that isn't the only situation brought up by the authors. They talk about a scenario in which machines autonomously produce "artifacts and meanings that humans can neither fully understand nor meaningfully engage with." Can we imagine a machine that \em{wants} to listen to esoteric music or look at abstract art? It's unclear why humans \em{want} to do this, aside from the fact that it brings us pleasure. A lot of people think of AI as entirely unemotional, motivated solely by statistics and maximization of some quantity or other, and it's hard to imagine what they could really \em{want} in the absence of human-programmed goals.}

\p{But even though it's hard to imagine, many people have tried, and produced human art in the process! There is a vast, vast amount of science fiction (and writing \em{about} science fiction) that explores the nature of the human mind, of inhuman minds, and of what might happen when they come into conflict.}

\p{I'm certainly not the most well-read science fiction fan, and I have never seriously tried to write my own. But I think having read a decent amount makes it much easier for me to imagine motivations and desires completely alien from my own and to begin to understand where we are today. At various points during the discussion, I found myself thinking back to different books and short stories I've read to compare and contrast with the scenarios brought up by the authors, by the members of the group, and the current state of the world.}

\p{I wasn't the only one doing this: someone (I'm very sorry I don't know your name!) brought up the Ted Chiang short story "The Evolution of Human Science" while I was trying to remember if I had read anything relevant by Borges—I had forgotten about this story! But this particular short story will lead us into a discussion of mechanized mathematics, which I don't want to do yet.}

\p{Below will be a list of books and short stories that came to mind during the discussion, and some that were pointed out to me after the fact.}}

\subtree{\title{Sci-fi-mediated understanding of AI is important}
\p{Another major point in the discussion was the difficulty in imagining how we get to a point where there are AIs with independent "volition" which includes creating "cultural artefacts" given that (most of the time) what we consider AIs do not seem to posess any. (I think whether or not LLMs can be said to have goals beyond "predict the next token" should be up for serious debate, but that's not what I'm debating right now.)}

\p{I have two main responses to this. The first is essentially a repetition of the first section: many smart people have thought about this in the past; we should read what they have said and consider whether or not it holds up in the current landscape.}

\p{The second is that for discussions like these, it kind of \em{doesn't matter} how it could happen. One undeniable fact is that there is a very large contingent of competent and poweful people who view it as a moral imperative to bring about "true AGI" complete with its own desires and motivations, and this may either help or hurt human flourishing. This was only hinted at in one screenshot from the presentation of the reading at the beginning of the discussion: there was a pyramid of preservation, or something, where the base corresponded to wanting to ensure your immediate family's survival, the middle was ensuring humanity's survival, and the top was "cosmic" and referred to ensuring the survival of \em{any} consciousness at all.}

\p{So while imagining \em{how} "true AGI" with desires etc. that ends up engaging in its own incomprehensible forms of cultural production could be helpful in preparing for the risks, it is strictly not necessary. Moreover, it being difficult to imagine does not preclude it from happening. Again, people are actively and explicitly trying to make this happen.}
}

\p{Moreover, many of the people working on this are heavily influenced by science fiction. They grew up reading it, like I did. I think it is important to understand the accompanying philosophies and how they affect the work being done, especially since now they are directly influencing the technology being produced.}

\p{Philosophy influencing politics, culture, the economy, is nothing new. But a lot of science fiction has kind of a chip on its shoulder from being considered low-brow as it often was in the beginning of its larger popularity... the really O.G. stuff (Margaret Cavendish, Mary Shelley, etc.) was unapologetically philosophical. Then a large portion of it became too pulpy for "serious" people (although one of the books that I recommend below is undeniably a pulp novel) and this gave sci-fi a bad rap. But serious philosophy has been happening in these books for a long time.}

\p{I would have more examples if I didn't have my computer set to only allow me to go on Twitter and Instagram for 15 mintues per day. Perhaps I will collect some over the course of the next few days. But for now, I'll provide one direct example of science fiction influencing technology and politics simultaneously.}

\p{Jorge Luis Borges wrote a short story called \em{Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius}. It is classically Borgesian: a story about a book that does not exist, written as though it were real. The book is an encyclopedia from a fictional world, and the conceit is that as people in the universe of the story read from this encyclopedia, the world described therein became real in the story's world. Curtis Yarvin, recently profiled in the \em{New Yorker} as an important figure in the alt-right, created a computer system called Urbit, which prioritizes decentralization. He named the organization that develops it Tlon, after the short story. He at some point left the organization and now has returned, which I believe caused some controversy in the Urbit community. But this is someone who explicitly brings science fiction themes to his work, and he is a competent, powerful, well-connected person!}

\p{There's a famous [meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/torment-nexus) that gets reposted when someone touts their new invention that is remarkably similar to something whose negative consequences have been explored in the context of science fiction. But the framing of many uses of the meme are unclear. Do the posters imply that the tech bros are deliberately causing harm? Do they believe that they are being willfully or unintentionally ignorant of the already-explored negative consequences? Or do they miss the fact that sometimes, the tech bros believe that what they are doing is good? It's }

\subtree{\title{Sci-fi recommendations for the AI age}
\p{Lucy's recommendations:}
\ol{
  \li{Ursula K. Le Guin's author's note to \em{The Left Hand of Darkness}
  \ul{
    \li{"Science fiction is not predictive, it is descriptive."}
    \li{Read to find out what one of the sci-fi greats thinks about the funciton of her genre.}
    \li{She claims that science fiction writers do not predict the future; instead she claims that they perform thought experiments. And I think thought experiments are exactly what we were trying to do in the discussion today.}
  }}
  \li{"I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream" by Harlan Ellison
    \ul{
      \li{A pretty on-the-nose subject matter here: the story follows five characters who are the last humans alive on Earth after it has been taken over by a hostile AI.}
      \li{The hostile supercomputer's ends mainly include taking revenge on humanity for creating it.}
    }
  }
  \li{"The Machine Stops" by E.M. Forster
  \ul{
    \li{A story about a future in which humans live in cells underground, physically separated from others but in virtual contact with each other.}
    \li{Humans live reasonably enriched lives. The main character's mother, for instance, enjoys studying art and giving talks on the things she has learned. But this definitely reads as somewhat of a dig at academics.}
    \li{The machine eventually breaks down (hence the title) and the survivors of the ensuing calamity must figure out how to live in the natural world again.}
  }}
  \li{"Amnesty" by Octavia Butler
    \ul{
      \li{This short story explores the relationship between a human "translator" and the alien species that has come to make colonies on Earth.}
      \li{The Communities, as they are called, were initially unable to communicate with humans, and the translator was part of a group of people that developed a language that both humans and Communities can understand.}
      \li{In spite of this new language, the motivations, organization, and nature of the Communities is not at all understood.}
      \li{The economy of the world has been disrupted by the arrival of the Communities, and has in many ways reoriented itself around them.}
    }}
  \li{\em{The Diamond Age} by Neal Stephenson
  \ul{
    \li{The plot of \em{The Diamond Age} centers on a disadvantaged young girl who becomes extraordinary because she is tutored by an AI book with [human fallback](https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-44/essays/human_fallback/).}
    \li{Another example of science fiction directly informing technology: in college, I met a guy at a party who told me about his startup. I had just finished reading \em{The Diamond Age} ([so had Ivanka Trump, apparently](https://x.com/IvankaTrump/status/1871251882351755547)) and what he was telling me sounded suspiciously like it, so I asked him if he had ever read it. His face lit up and he said something along the lines of "\em{yes}, that's exactly what I'm trying to bring to life! Usually when I explain my startup I start with the plot of the book. Today I decided not to and it still came up." }
  }}
  \li{\em{The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch} by Philip K. Dick
  \ul{
    \li{I think the notion of "slop" is important to the discussion about the kinds of art AI would create. It might not be what AIs create to exchange among themselves, but as we see more and more AI-generated slop targeted at children it's important to explore what the consequences of this might be.}
    \li{\em{The Three Stigmata} takes place in a near-future climate dystopia where people get "drafted" to colonize new planets. Life on these new planets is terrible, so people resort to a particular kind of hallucinogenic drug as a form of escape, but the nature of the drug is somehow collective, so it forms a new kind of culture, distinct from anything seen before and outside of human influence in some ways.}
  }}
  \li{And of course the classic mid-century dystopian novels like \em{1984} and \em{Brave New World}, which always seem to go together.
  \ul{
    \li{I put these in here because they are probably the most familiar examples of the "humans being subjected to the incomprehensible will of an incomprehensible being/organization."}
    \li{Both of these "societies" have their populi controlled and kept down for the purposes of the maintenance of state power. The states subjugate their people by different means (in \em{1984} it is what we classically conceive of as authoritarian control, censorship, etc; while in \em{BNW} it's more satisfaction-by-slop.)}
    \li{But in both cases, the average person doesn't get to understand the state's motives or aims. In fact, in \em{1984} part of the whole thing is that people are deliberately confused by the actions and claims of the state: "Oceania had always been at war with Eastasia," etc.}

\p{Other people's recommendations:}
\ol{
  \li{"The Evolution of Human Science" by Ted Chiang
  \ul{
    \li{Recommended by someone whose name I don't know!}
    \li{This is a Borgesian piece: written like a news article describing a future where "metahumans" perform scientific research that is inaccessible to normal humans.}
    \li{The metahumans are presumably still human and so still require material comforts (though the article is set in a post-scarcity world) and intellectual stimulation, so we can presume that their motives for doing research (i.e. producing cultural artefacts) are nominally similar to ours. We don't know what an AI might require.}
    \li{With respect to this, I'd also point to [Silicon Reckoner](https://siliconreckoner.substack.com), mathematician Michael Harris's blog criticizing the mechanization of mathematics (I'm not totally sure whether or not he includes formalization per se or just automation in his targets for criticism).}
  }}
  \li{\em{Player of Games} by Iain M. Banks.
  \ul{
    \li{Recommended by Adam Lesnikowski.}
    \li{The second book in the \em{Culture} series.}
    \li{Adam recommended it over the first because the first is told from the perspective of a character who hates the AIs, and if our goal is to understand them, perhaps we need a more sympathetic perspective.}
    \li{For an exploration of foreign consciousnesses, I think one could also read Banks's \em{The Algebraist}, but I didn't get very far into this one as I wasn't a huge fan of the prose.}
  }}
}
\p{Less immidiately relevant things that I think can still be tenuously connected and anyway are interesting:
  \ol{
    \li{Other works by Neal Stephenson!
    \ul{
      \li{\em{Anathem} (or at least parts of it) because it contains an exploration of what happens when knowledge production happens separately from its practical applications—sort of an (un-)natural extension of modern academia.}
      \li{\em{Snow Crash} for an exploration of slop (but this is another book I didn't finish because I couldn't handle the prose).}}}
      \li{Personally I've found Stephenson to be one of the most prescient writers.}
    \li{\em{The Last Starship from Earth} by John Boyd
  \ul{
    \li{This is not a super strong recommendation as the relevant themes go woefully underexplored in this pulpy novel. Regardless, it's a quick and interesting read, set in an alternate-history 1960s version of Berkeley, featuring an "AI Pope."}

\p{Other \em{relevant}, not strictly sci-fi recommendations:
\ol{
  \li{Katherine Dee's blog}
  \li{[Silicon Reckoner](https://siliconreckoner.substack.com)
  \ul{
    \li{Michael Harris frequently brings up the status of mathematics as "a way of being human," and emphasizes the importance of human creativity. Humans decide which theorems to prove, which is sort of like an art form. So what would it mean for mathematics if machines were deciding what to prove?}
    \li{Formalization has played an important role in the development of AI mathematicians. It would be difficult to check an LLM's natural language proof, so common practice is to have them write formalized proofs in some theorem-proving languge, which is easy to check.}
    \li{But also, while some people claim that mathematics is a purely artistic pursuit, [others disagree](ref-0008)!}
  }}}
  \li{I think Ayn Rand's major works are relevant, or at least they were a few months ago when there was talk about a "pause" on AI development. Rand railed against government restrictions on innovation, and a lot of people working on AI saw the threat of government regulation as akin to the events of \em{Atlas Shrugged} and \em{The Fountainhead}.}
